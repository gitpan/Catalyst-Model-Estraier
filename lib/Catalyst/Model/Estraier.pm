=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Model::Estraier - Hyper Estraier model class for Catalyst


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Use the Catalyst helper
    $ perl script/myapp_create.pl model Search Estraier \
      http://localhost:1978/node/test admin admin

    # Or, in lib/MyApp/Model/Search.pm
    package MyApp::Model::Search;

    use base qw(Catalyst::Model::Estraier);

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        url            => 'http://localhost:1978/node/test',
        user           => 'admin',
        passwd         => 'admin',
        croak_on_error => 1,
    );

    1;

    # Then, in your controller
    my $node = $c->model('Search'); # Search::Estraier::Node
    my $rs = $node->search($cond, 0);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the L<Search::Estraier> model class for Catalyst.  It is nothing more
than a simple wrapper for L<Search::Estraier>.

Please refer to the L<Search::Estraier> documentation for information on what
else is available.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following configuration parameters are supported:

=over 4

=item * C<url>

URL to a Hyper Estraier node

=item * C<user>

specify username for node server authentication

=item * C<passwd>

password for authentication

=item * C<create>

create node if it doesn't exists

=item * C<label>

optional label for new node if create is used

=item * C<debug>

dumps a lot of debugging output

=item * C<croak_on_error>

very helpful during development. It will croak on all errors instead
of silently returning -1 (which is convention of Hyper Estraier API
in other languages).
